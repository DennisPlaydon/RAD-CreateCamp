# RAD-CreateCamp
KRAD-JJ's creation at a 2018 hackathon run by Summer of Tech.

Our creation is Mesh'd, a website to find out what a potential new neighbourhood could be like, and this information could prove useful in helping a potential home buyer or tenant make a decision if this new neighbourhood is right for them.

## Stack
We used React on the front end and Express Js on the backend which queried a data store. Our team chose these technologies because it was something new that we had no touched before. We learnt how to render objects using React and how to query data stores.

## My Role
I was on the front end team which handled accepted a response from the backend that was tied to a contract and display it using React components.
